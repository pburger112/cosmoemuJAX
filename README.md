# Emulator 3pt

This package is oriented on the CosmoPower (https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/tree/main) and CosmoPower JAX (https://github.com/dpiras/cosmopower-jax) emulators. However, it does the training of emulators similar to CosmoPower, but entirely in JAX. Therefore, it is independent of TensorFlow and can be easily used for gradient-dependent inferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

We recommend using a dedicated `conda` environment for clean dependency management.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pburger112/cosmoemuJAX.git
cd cosmoemuJAX
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Conda Environment

```bash
conda create -n cosmoemu_JAX_env python=3.10 
conda activate cosmoemu_JAX_env
```

### 3. Install the Package

Install the package and its dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install . ".[cpu]" 
```

If you need editable/development mode:

```bash
pip install -e . ".[cpu]"
```

If you want use the Mac M1,M2,M3 GPU install like:

```bash
pip install . ".[gpu]" 
```

If you need editable/development mode:

```bash
pip install -e . ".[gpu]"
```
